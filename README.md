As a movie enthusiast, I've always been curious about how recommendation and search systems work under the hood. I noticed that many streaming apps, that may be great for browsing, often lack the a deep, specific movie details exploration i was looking for‚Äîlike seeing films from a particular production company or by director.

This project started as a way to explore that problem. I wanted to build a movie discovery tool that was more granular and powerful, and also use it as a practical exercise to take an app from concept to production on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jozaforge.moviealike&hl=en). It's been a fantastic learning experience in building a full-stack mobile application, and this repository serves as a log of that journey and the architectural choices made along the way.

-   **Contextual Movie Exploration:** Start with a movie you already like and dive into a deep exploration path. From a movie's detail page, you can discover new movies by tapping on any actor, director, genre, or production company to see a filtered list of filmes.
-   **Intelligent Recommendations:** Instead of a black box, the recommendation engine uses a **[Jaccard Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index)** algorithm. This provides a clear, percentage-based "similarity score," giving a tangible reason why a movie is recommended, compared to many modern recommendations systems that use machine learn models, this project jaccard similatiry system using genres and keywords from tmdb database, has a really good result in showing similar recommendations and sometimes better ones, with the plus that it shows how much similar a recommended movie is to the one selected.
-   **Personal Watchlist & Details:** Keep track of movies you want to watch and dive deep into details with trailers, cast bios, and crew information, all stored locally for a smooth and responsive experience.

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Architecture%20&%20Tech%20Stack-252836?style=for-the-badge" alt="Architecture & Tech Stack">

This app is built with a focus on creating a scalable, maintainable, and testable codebase. The foundation is <strong style="color:#FF4081;">Clean Architecture</strong>, which strictly separates the project into three distinct layers: Presentation, Domain, and Data.

### Architecture Layers:


**üé® Presentation Layer** (`lib/presentation/`)
- **Screens & Widgets**: Flutter UI components (Home, Search, MovieDetails, Watchlist)
- **BLoCs**: State management using BLoC pattern (HomeBloc, SearchBloc, etc.)
- **Navigation**: GoRouter for declarative routing

**üß† Domain Layer** (`lib/domain/`)
- **Use Cases**: Single-purpose business operations (`GetPopularMovies`, `GetMovieDetails`)
- **Repository Interfaces**: Abstract contracts (`MovieRepository`, `SearchRepository`)
- **Domain Models**: Pure business entities (`Movie`, `CastMember`, `MovieDetails`)

**üíæ Data Layer** (`lib/data/`)
- **Repository Implementations**: Concrete implementations (`MovieRepositoryImpl`)
- **Data Sources**: API and database access (`MovieDataSource`, `WatchListDataSource`)
- **DTOs**: Data Transfer Objects for external communication
